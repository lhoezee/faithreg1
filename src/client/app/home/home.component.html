<p>
    This extended class will offer further in-depth discussions and training on using the latest web development
    technologies
    preparing students to enter into the professional work field of web development.
</p>

<h2>When we meet:</h2>
<p>We will meet after the Faith Homeschool classes dismisses in the computer lab downstairs. We are expecting the class
    to take about 1 hour to 1.5 hours.</p>

<h2>What we will cover:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Beginner through advanced level Javascript</li>
    <li>Web frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS which are used by large enterprise companies to build their
        online web applications.
    </li>
    <li>Learn how to use version control systems such as Git. This allows multiple developers to work on the same
        project and control source code versions.
    </li>
    <li>Learn how to create web forms and save information to a backend server, such as the registration page on this
        site.
    </li>
    <li>Occasionally we may work on real world projects such as banking applications and more.</li>
    <li>Many more items that come with day-to-day development practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>The goal of the class:</h2>
<p>
    The primary goal of this class is to explore all the different aspects of the web technology industry which will
    allow the
    student to get an understanding if this is what he or she would like to pursuit as a career option.
</p>
<p>
    If the student wishes to continue learning, it will also be our goal to get them prepared to enter into the
    professional workplace right out of high school
    if this is what they choose.
</p>


<h2>Who can join:</h2>
<p>Any student in 10th, 11th, or 12th grade. We ask the students should be serious about this as we will be fully
    focused on their success and education.</p>
